# Car-Name-Plate-Detection
Car Name Plate Detection is used to detect car’s number plates to read it. The app is helpful for people working in security since if something happens to someone’s car and you need to read the license plate, the code will zoom in and scan it. It would then give you the license plate which would be easier than zooming in and trying to read it.
